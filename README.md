## Acknowledgements

This library was inspired by the work in [ngx-multi-sort-table](https://github.com/Maxl94/ngx-multi-sort-table). While it was created from scratch and is an independent implementation tailored to specific use cases, their ideas and approach provided valuable guidance in its creation. Many thanks for their contributions to the open-source community!
