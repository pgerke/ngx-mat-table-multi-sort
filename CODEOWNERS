# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The '\*' pattern matches all files in the repository.
* @pgerke @michix99

# Specific directories or files can have different owners.
# For example, to make someone else the owner of the src directory:
# /src/ @another-github-username
# You can also specify multiple owners for a file or directory.
# /docs/ @your-github-username @another-github-username
